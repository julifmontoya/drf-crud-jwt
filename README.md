## 1. Project Goals
The purpose of this project is to create a Django Rest Framework API

## 2. Technologies I've used
- Python was used to write the functions and models as needed by the business logic.
- Django Rest Framework was used to create the project and appâ€™s functionality (Models, Serializers and Views).

## 3. Database Design
This is the Relational Database used to create the models for the web application. 

## 4. User stories

###  4.3 Update Post

## 6. Testing
### 6.1 API Endpoints Testing
- I verify that all API endpoints are working correctly and returning the expected responses.
- Each endpoint was tested with different HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to ensure proper functionality.
- I check the appropriate status codes (e.g., 200 OK, 201 Created, 400 Bad Request, 404 Not Found) for different scenarios.

### 6.2 Input Validation Testing
- The input validation for all API endpoints corresponding with the fields of the models

### 6.3 Data Integrity Testing
- I verify the integrity of data stored in the database by performing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations through the API.
- I checked that data is saved correctly, updated accurately, and deleted successfully.
- I checked that data retrieval is returned for different scenarios.

### 6.4 Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) Testing:
- I verified that the appropriate CORS headers are included in API responses.
